this is a test blurb  

Module 3:  

Topics: More HTML, more CSS, browser differences, and interesting problems and fixes  

More HTML and more CSS:  
  - Background color, background image, width (and fit-content!), height, overflow, box sizing and vendor prefix  
  - Float, clear, position, z-index, display, inheritance  
  - Linking to css from an external file  

Browser differences:  
  - Browser defaults and a way to reset defaults (a reset stylesheet)  

Another interesting problem and some fixes:  
  - Collapsed containers (clearfix and overflow)  


Note: this format here is to note that we need to cover this topic still  
Create yet another design for a web app that you would want to use...  

Create (or modify) a web page that attempts to implement yet more aspects of your design, 
but now include additional CSS properties:

# DESIGN  

1. This week I must decide whether I should proceed to develop one of my sites.  
I think I would be using a Doge explorer more often than a movie review site for  
LDP movies, but I think the LDP site has a more straightforward back end that will  
be easier for me to make a comprehensive design.  
-- Decision - I will develop Louvie.com  
2. The front page should be cleaned up and simplified. I think adding a few dropdowns at the  
top along with a banner image. Could use a fragment identifier for the main movie list and  
have a separate page for each movie and each respective review. Must add attribution for images.  
3. Would like a search function for each movie somehow. Classes? IDs? Probably IDs.  
4. I would like to float images to the right of my ordered list of tables.
5. create a class for the individual movie page links
6. need to populate the individual pages for the movies, then href to them with an anchor.
7. change multiple breaks to either float, padding, margin, sticking, anything else.  
8. Add background image to the body, instead of html style
9. must clean up stylesheet. (css code)
