this is a test blurb  

Module 3:  

Topics: More HTML, more CSS, browser differences, and interesting problems and fixes  

More HTML and more CSS:  
  - Background color, background image, width (and fit-content!), height, overflow, box sizing and vendor prefix  
  - Float, clear, position, z-index, display, inheritance  
  - Linking to css from an external file  

Browser differences:  
  - Browser defaults and a way to reset defaults (a reset stylesheet)  

Another interesting problem and some fixes:  
  - Collapsed containers (clearfix and overflow)  


Note: this format here is to note that we need to cover this topic still
