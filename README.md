# DESIGN  

1. This week I must decide whether I should proceed to develop one of my sites. I think I would be using a Doge explorer more often than a movie review site for LDP movies, but I think the LDP site has a more straightforward back end that will be easier for me to make a comprehensive design.  
-- Decision - I will develop Louvie.com  
2. The front page should be cleaned up and simplified. I think adding a few dropdowns at the top along with a banner image. Could use a fragment identifier for the main movie list and have a separate page for each movie and each respective review. Must add attribution for images.   
3. Would like a search function for each movie somehow. Classes? IDs? Probably IDs.  
4. I would like to float images to the right of my ordered list of tables.
5. create a class for the individual movie page links
6. need to populate the individual pages for the movies, then href to them with an anchor.  
7. change multiple breaks to either float, padding, margin, sticking, anything else.   
8. Add background image to the body, instead of html style
9. must clean up stylesheet. (css code)
